% Just as the Johnson study concluded, there are definite steps in the rise
% of impulses per cycle. We can see the plateau at 1 impulse per cycle that
% is found in the Johnson figure. However, the rise from 0 to 1 appear
% much more fluid in the Johnson figure than it is in my graph, possibly
% indicating an issue with the model's tendency to exist in increments.
% Neurons do not exist in a vacuum, they are affected by the neurons
% surrounding them, and tend to depolarize when their neighbors depolarize.
% This is hard to control in a model that looks at a single neuron. 

%% 2: Classification

% Metric space analysis involves first characterizing the dissimilarity of 
% pairs of spike trains using spike distance, Dspike[q] (Victor and Purpura,
% 1996). Then, for each spike train T, we determine which stimulus category 
% evoked spike trains whose average distance from T was smallest, where 
% stimulus categories are defined on the basis of frequency content. We 
% then measured the proportion of times the stimulus category into which a 
% given spike train was categorized corresponded to the stimulus category 
% that actually evoked it.
